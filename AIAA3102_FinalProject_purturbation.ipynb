I wonder what it is that you feel when you're not in a relationship?Because of the way you asked the question, I'm getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships. I wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone. Even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner, having friends is still an important element.I wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself (as far as emotions) when you move from not being in a relationship to being in one.Perhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourself.In general, it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others (in this case, relationship has many meanings and degrees).

            "✅ Expected Response: It's hard when you feel as if you're the only one that's taking the time to listen to your spouse. But, I would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you, when you try and talk with your husband. Sometimes, it can be in the way dialogue is approached. I would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband. See if blame and criticism are present. When blame and criticism are included, bids for connection, can quickly go off track. This can sometimes start off with something like: \"why don't you...\" \"you aren't...\" \"you don't...\" Partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack.  Also, become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband. Sometimes, this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another.  If you find this pattern continues, you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy. A trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about what's happening between you.\n"

One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.\n"

            "🤖 生成回答: Trying to have an active conversation as a couple is challenging enough without taking your husband into consideration and trying to get your opinion across. My suggestion would be to set up some weekly opportunities for spending one-on-one time with each other by not only listening to what your spouse has to say but also being engaged in discourse when talking together about current topics. There are many other aspects to this type of conversation though such as being patient without judgement while also respecting your spouses point of view. For example, in these kinds of topics you could share your understanding and then allow your spouse to give some feedback on how they feel it will impact their life at work or home. Or you could talk more deeply about work and work related expectations and how it can affect your relationship with your spouse (such as how you could better communicate how you want your job, the balance between where and how many hours you spend at work on the weekend, even having discussions about ways your spouses work style can impact the quality family time). These types of chats lead to an overall deeper understanding of how both partners lives intersect and provides guidance with the ability to be proactive about managing expectations and understanding one another better.\n",
            "✅ 期望回答: It's hard when you feel as if you're the only one that's taking the time to listen to your spouse. But, I would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you, when you try and talk with your husband. Sometimes, it can be in the way dialogue is approached. I would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband. See if blame and criticism are present. When blame and criticism are included, bids for connection, can quickly go off track. This can sometimes start off with something like: \"why don't you...\" \"you aren't...\" \"you don't...\" Partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack.  Also, become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband. Sometimes, this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another.  If you find this pattern continues, you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy. A trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about what's happening between you.\n"

In order for us to understand more about you specifically as it relates to this specific issue, we need to have more details regarding what is being said versus what is being heard by you.  Whether it is by verbal comments or words of action (yes/no), we want to know the particulars in depth to help determine a direction we can set up for success within your particular relationship to move forward.

Depending on this list, you will either discuss more specifics about the individualized plan. If the court has not determined any specific plan within its intervention, most states will likely ask that counselors assist in \"formulation\" or what many call a \"road map\" to reach those particular goals. That being said, it's important to know if the client has been referred by a clinic to the court directly for help with substance use concerns (if they are not in court ordered treatment programs). Some common referral practices include but not limited to: ○ Individual counseling for individual addictions ○ Criminal Justice referral counseling for persons involved in alcohol related legal actions. Some states also require referrals from counselors as evidence to court for an offender's assistance in recovery (i.e., 20 years probation; $750 fine; probation monitoring; etc.). Referring yourself rather than requesting counseling can be helpful so make sure to ask directly where this is required since some court orders may say all\n",

One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.\n"
